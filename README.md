# Data_Analytics_Iris_Research
** by Serhii Spitsyn**

## Project Descriptions
Explore the Iris dataset in this repository, featuring data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models for species classification.

## About the data
This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

Number of Instances: 150 (50 in each of three classes)
Number of Attributes: 4 numeric, predictive attributes and the class

Attribute Information:
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class: 
      -- Iris Setosa
      -- Iris Versicolour
      -- Iris Virginica

## Stack
- Data - Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- Visualization - Matplotlib
- Streamlit - Python, Pandas
- Version Control and CI/CD - GitHub Projects, GitHub Actions

## Imports
Use pandas for the DataFrame data structure. It allows us to investigate CSV files amongst amongst other features!

## Goals
- To accurately segment iris into distinct clusters
- To develop skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and the application of unsupervised learning techniques
- To establish a versatile clustering pipeline applicable to subsequent projects
